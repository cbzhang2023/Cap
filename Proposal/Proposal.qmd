## Proposal: Predicting Rental Prices with Business Trends

## 1. Project Overview

Rental prices in urban areas are influenced by various factors, including business activities, geographical accessibility, and economic growth patterns. This project aims to build a comprehensive understanding of how business trends affect rental markets by leveraging postal codes for spatial mapping, conducting spatial analyses, and using machine learning to predict future rental price trends. The project will culminate in an R Shiny dashboard and an R Quarto report documenting the entire process and insights.

## 2. Objectives

**Understand Business Trends:**

Analyze temporal and spatial patterns of business registrations and closures using postal codes for accurate geolocation.

Identify business hotspots and trends over time.

**Assess Geographical Accessibility:**

Examine how accessibility to business hubs affects rental prices.

Model the impact of spatial factors such as proximity and density on rental prices.

**Predict Future Rental Prices:**

Develop a predictive model that incorporates business trends, geographical accessibility, and property characteristics.

## 3. Data Overview

**Dataset 1**: EntitiesRegisteredwithACRA.csv

Contains information on business registrations and closures, including postal codes for geospatial identification.

**Key Columns:**

Business ID, Registration Date, Closure Date

Business Type, Sector

Location (postal code or address)

**Dataset 2**: RentingOutofFlats2024CSV.csv

Includes residential rental price data.

**Key Columns:**

Rental Price, Lease Type, Property Type

Location (postal code or address), Lease Duration

Start Date, End Date

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing

**Cleaning and Standardization:**

Remove duplicates and handle missing values.

Standardize date formats and ensure consistent variable naming conventions.

**Geocoding Using Postal Codes:**

Extract postal codes from Dataset 1 (EntitiesRegisteredwithACRA.csv) and Dataset 2 (RentingOutofFlats2024CSV.csv).

**Use postal codes to determine spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude):**

Use APIs like Google Maps, OneMap (Singapore), or OpenStreetMap.

Cross-validate results with an authoritative postal code database to ensure accuracy.

Generate a spatial dataset with precise geolocations for businesses and rental properties.

**Spatial Integration:**

Integrate datasets by matching geographical regions or proximity.

Use postal code-based boundaries for initial integration and fine-tune with exact coordinates.

### **4.2 Geocoding Using Geocode.xyz API**

#### **Purpose**

To transform detailed address information into precise spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each rental property.

#### **Steps**

1.  **Prepare Full Address**

    Construct a `full_address` field by concatenating key address components:

2.  **Geocoding Process**

    Use the **Geocode.xyz API** to convert the `full_address` into geographic coordinates:

    Input: Full address string.

    ```{r}
    library(readr)

    reantal_unclean_data <- read_csv("data/RentingOutofFlats2024CSV.csv")

    head(reantal_unclean_data, 5)

    ```

    ![](/images/clipboard-3740434886.png)

3.  Output: Latitude and longitude values returned by the API.

    ```{r}
    library(readr)

    reantal_data <- read_csv("data/merged_hdb_with_coordinates.csv")

    head(reantal_unclean_data, 5)
    ```

    ![](/images/clipboard-25686400.png)

4.  **API Configuration**

    Geocode.xyz provides accurate geocoding for global locations, including Singapore. The API allows queries for full address strings and returns precise geographic coordinates along with additional metadata.

5.  **Error Handling and Validation**

    Monitor the API responses to handle:

    Invalid or ambiguous address queries.

    API rate limits by batching requests or incorporating pauses between queries.

    Cross-validate geocoded coordinates using authoritative postal code boundaries to ensure accuracy.

### 4.3 Geographical Accessibility Modeling

#### 4.3.1 Travel Time and Proximity Analysis

##### Purpose

To compute the travel times between rental properties and business clusters, and to analyze their proximity to key infrastructure such as public transport stations, major roads, and business hubs. This analysis will provide essential features for later predictive modeling.

##### Methodology

We will perform **network-based spatial analysis** using tools such as:

-   **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)** for real-time routing and travel time calculation.
-   **gdistance** package in R to compute the least-cost path based on road networks.

##### Travel Time Calculation Using OSRM

OSRM is used to calculate travel times between rental properties and business hotspots based on the shortest paths over a road network.

Given a set of rental property locations ( P = {p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n} ) and a set of business hotspots ( H = {h_1, h_2, \dots, h_m} ), the travel time between a property ( p_i ) and a hotspot ( h_j ) is calculated as:

$$
T(p_i, h_j) = f(\text{distance}, \text{speed limit}, \text{road type})
$$

Where:\
- ( T(p_i, h_j) ) is the travel time from property ( p_i ) to hotspot ( h_j ).\
- ( \text{distance} ) is the road distance between the two points.\
- ( \text{speed limit} ) is the maximum speed allowed on each segment of the road network.\
- ( \text{road type} ) accounts for road hierarchies (e.g., highways, local streets).

##### Proximity Analysis

Proximity to key infrastructure will be computed using **Euclidean distance** and **network distance**.

The Euclidean distance between two points ( (x_1, y_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2) ) is calculated as:

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

However, since real-world travel happens along road networks, **network distance** will be used for a more realistic analysis. Network distance is computed by summing the lengths of road segments between two points.

##### Accessibility to Public Transport and Major Roads

We will calculate the proximity of rental properties to:

-   **MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) stations**
-   **Bus stops**
-   **Major roads and expressways**

Let ( p_i ) be a rental property, and ( t_j ) be the nearest transport station:

$$
D(p_i, t_j) = \min \{d(p_i, t_k) \mid t_k \in T\}
$$

Where:\
- ( D(p_i, t_j) ) is the shortest network distance from property ( p_i ) to the nearest transport station ( t_j ).\
- ( T ) is the set of all transport stations.

#### 4.3.2 Accessibility Index Development

To develop an **Accessibility Index** that combines various accessibility metrics, including travel time, proximity to business hubs, and density of nearby businesses.

The **Accessibility Index (AI)** for a rental property ( p_i ) is calculated as:

$$
AI(p_i) = \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{T(p_i, h_j)} + \beta \cdot \frac{1}{D(p_i, t_j)} + \gamma \cdot B(p_i)
$$

Where:\
- ( T(p_i, h_j) ) is the travel time from property ( p_i ) to the nearest business hub ( h_j ).\
- ( D(p_i, t_j) ) is the network distance from property ( p_i ) to the nearest transport station ( t_j ).\
- ( B(p_i) ) is the density of businesses within a defined radius around ( p_i ).\
- ( \alpha ), ( \beta ), and ( \gamma ) are weighting factors to balance the importance of each component.

### 4.4 Rental Price Modeling

#### 4.4.1 Feature Engineering

##### Purpose

To create additional variables (features) that capture spatial, temporal, and property-related characteristics for use in predictive modeling.

##### Derived Features

1.  **Spatial Features**
    -   Accessibility Index (computed in Section 4.3).\
    -   Proximity to business hubs, public transport, and major roads.\
    -   Density of nearby businesses.
2.  **Temporal Features**
    -   Yearly and monthly rental trends.\
    -   Seasonal variations (e.g., higher rents during certain months).
3.  **Property Features**
    -   Property type (e.g., 3-room, 4-room).\
    -   Lease type (e.g., short-term, long-term).\
    -   Lease duration.

#### 4.4.2 Predictive Modeling

##### Purpose

To build machine learning models that predict rental prices based on the derived features.

##### Methodology

We will use the following machine learning algorithms:

1.  **Random Forest (RF)**\
2.  **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**\
3.  **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**

##### Random Forest Model

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy.

The predicted rental price ( \hat{y} ) is computed as:

$$
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x)
$$

Where:\
- ( n ) is the number of decision trees in the forest.\
- ( f_i(x) ) is the prediction from the ( i\^{th} ) tree.

##### Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate the models using the following metrics:

1.  **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**\
    Measures the average magnitude of errors.

    $$
    RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}
    $$

2.  **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**\
    Measures how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.

    $$
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
    $$

3.  **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\
    Measures the average absolute error between predicted and actual values.

    $$
    MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |\hat{y}_i - y_i|
    $$

#### 4.4.3 Model Interpretation and Insights

Once the models are trained and evaluated, feature importance analysis will be conducted to identify the most significant factors affecting rental prices. The insights derived from the models will inform stakeholders about key drivers of rental price fluctuations.
