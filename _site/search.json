    "text": "4. Methodology\n\n4.1 Data Preprocessing\nCleaning and Standardization:\nRemove duplicates and handle missing values.\nStandardize date formats and ensure consistent variable naming conventions.\nGeocoding Using Postal Codes:\nExtract postal codes from Dataset 1 (EntitiesRegisteredwithACRA.csv) and Dataset 2 (RentingOutofFlats2024CSV.csv).\nUse postal codes to determine spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude):\nUse APIs like Google Maps, OneMap (Singapore), or OpenStreetMap.\nCross-validate results with an authoritative postal code database to ensure accuracy.\nGenerate a spatial dataset with precise geolocations for businesses and rental properties.\nSpatial Integration:\nIntegrate datasets by matching geographical regions or proximity.\nUse postal code-based boundaries for initial integration and fine-tune with exact coordinates.\n\n\n4.2 Geocoding Using Geocode.xyz API\n\nPurpose\nTo transform detailed address information into precise spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each rental property.\n\n\nSteps\n\nPrepare Full Address\nConstruct a full_address field by concatenating key address components:\nGeocoding Process\nUse the Geocode.xyz API to convert the full_address into geographic coordinates:\nInput: Full address string.\n\nOutput: Latitude and longitude values returned by the API.\n\nAPI Configuration\nGeocode.xyz provides accurate geocoding for global locations, including Singapore. The API allows queries for full address strings and returns precise geographic coordinates along with additional metadata.\nError Handling and Validation\nMonitor the API responses to handle:\nInvalid or ambiguous address queries.\nAPI rate limits by batching requests or incorporating pauses between queries.\nCross-validate geocoded coordinates using authoritative postal code boundaries to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Geographical Accessibility Modeling\n\n4.3.1 Travel Time and Proximity Analysis\n\nPurpose\nTo compute the travel times between rental properties and business clusters, and to analyze their proximity to key infrastructure such as public transport stations, major roads, and business hubs. This analysis will provide essential features for later predictive modeling.\n\n\nMethodology\nWe will perform network-based spatial analysis using tools such as:\n\nOSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) for real-time routing and travel time calculation.\ngdistance package in R to compute the least-cost path based on road networks.\n\n\n\nTravel Time Calculation Using OSRM\nOSRM is used to calculate travel times between rental properties and business hotspots based on the shortest paths over a road network.\nGiven a set of rental property locations ( P = {p_1, p_2, , p_n} ) and a set of business hotspots ( H = {h_1, h_2, , h_m} ), the travel time between a property ( p_i ) and a hotspot ( h_j ) is calculated as:\n\\[\nT(p_i, h_j) = f(\\text{distance}, \\text{speed limit}, \\text{road type})\n\\]\nWhere:\n- ( T(p_i, h_j) ) is the travel time from property ( p_i ) to hotspot ( h_j ).\n- ( ) is the road distance between the two points.\n- ( ) is the maximum speed allowed on each segment of the road network.\n- ( ) accounts for road hierarchies (e.g., highways, local streets).\n\n\nProximity Analysis\nProximity to key infrastructure will be computed using Euclidean distance and network distance.\nThe Euclidean distance between two points ( (x_1, y_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2) ) is calculated as:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\nHowever, since real-world travel happens along road networks, network distance will be used for a more realistic analysis. Network distance is computed by summing the lengths of road segments between two points.\n\n\nAccessibility to Public Transport and Major Roads\nWe will calculate the proximity of rental properties to:\n\nMRT (Mass Rapid Transit) stations\nBus stops\nMajor roads and expressways\n\nLet ( p_i ) be a rental property, and ( t_j ) be the nearest transport station:\n\\[\nD(p_i, t_j) = \\min \\{d(p_i, t_k) \\mid t_k \\in T\\}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- ( D(p_i, t_j) ) is the shortest network distance from property ( p_i ) to the nearest transport station ( t_j ).\n- ( T ) is the set of all transport stations.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Accessibility Index Development\nTo develop an Accessibility Index that combines various accessibility metrics, including travel time, proximity to business hubs, and density of nearby businesses.\nThe Accessibility Index (AI) for a rental property ( p_i ) is calculated as:\n\\[\nAI(p_i) = \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{1}{T(p_i, h_j)} + \\beta \\cdot \\frac{1}{D(p_i, t_j)} + \\gamma \\cdot B(p_i)\n\\]\nWhere:\n- ( T(p_i, h_j) ) is the travel time from property ( p_i ) to the nearest business hub ( h_j ).\n- ( D(p_i, t_j) ) is the network distance from property ( p_i ) to the nearest transport station ( t_j ).\n- ( B(p_i) ) is the density of businesses within a defined radius around ( p_i ).\n- ( ), ( ), and ( ) are weighting factors to balance the importance of each component.\n\n\n\n4.4 Rental Price Modeling\n\n4.4.1 Feature Engineering\n\nPurpose\nTo create additional variables (features) that capture spatial, temporal, and property-related characteristics for use in predictive modeling.\n\n\nDerived Features\n\nSpatial Features\n\nAccessibility Index (computed in Section 4.3).\n\nProximity to business hubs, public transport, and major roads.\n\nDensity of nearby businesses.\n\nTemporal Features\n\nYearly and monthly rental trends.\n\nSeasonal variations (e.g., higher rents during certain months).\n\nProperty Features\n\nProperty type (e.g., 3-room, 4-room).\n\nLease type (e.g., short-term, long-term).\n\nLease duration.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Predictive Modeling\n\nPurpose\nTo build machine learning models that predict rental prices based on the derived features.\n\n\nMethodology\nWe will use the following machine learning algorithms:\n\nRandom Forest (RF)\n\nXGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)\n\nGradient Boosting Machines (GBM)\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Model\nRandom Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy.\nThe predicted rental price ( ) is computed as:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x)\n\\]\nWhere:\n- ( n ) is the number of decision trees in the forest.\n- ( f_i(x) ) is the prediction from the ( i^{th} ) tree.\n\n\nEvaluation Metrics\nWe will evaluate the models using the following metrics:\n\nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE)\nMeasures the average magnitude of errors.\n\\[\nRMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}\n\\]\nRÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)\nMeasures how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.\n\\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n\\]\nMean Absolute Error (MAE)\nMeasures the average absolute error between predicted and actual values.\n\\[\nMAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\hat{y}_i - y_i|\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Model Interpretation and Insights\nOnce the models are trained and evaluated, feature importance analysis will be conducted to identify the most significant factors affecting rental prices. The insights derived from the models will inform stakeholders about key drivers of rental price fluctuations.\n\n\n4.4.4 Prediction and Visualization\nForecasting Future Rental Prices:\nPredict rental price changes by incorporating temporal patterns of business activity.\nIdentify high-growth areas for strategic urban planning.\nInteractive R Shiny Dashboard:\nVisualize:\nBusiness trends over time and space.\nAccessibility analysis and its correlation with rental prices.\nPredicted rental price trends by region.\nR Quarto Report:\nDocument all analysis steps, methods, and findings.\nInclude visualizations such as heatmaps, spatial plots, and trend charts."
